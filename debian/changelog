libcarp-clan-perl (5.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved Carp/Clan.pm to libbit-vector-perl where it was before the
    split so that this package here has enough time to get accepted
    by the FTP maintainers. Closes: #276540

libcarp-clan-perl (5.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
    The modules were previously present in libbit-vector-perl but were
    splitted apart by the upstream author.

  * Smooth transition is assured as only the "psad" package depends uses
    Carp/Clan.pm and it also depends on libbit-vector-perl which depends
    on this package anyway.
